### `.htaccess` Configuration (Deployed Only)

This project leverages a robust `.htaccess` file (not maintained locally or in this repository) to ensure secure and seamless functionality. Below is an outline of the key rules configured:

- **Disable Directory Listing:** Prevents directory contents from being exposed to unauthorized users
- **Protect `.htaccess` File:** Restricts access to the `.htaccess` file itself.
- **Block Sensitive Files:** Denies access to files containing sensitive information (e.g. `.env`, `.json`).
- **Restrict PHP File Access:** Limits access to specific PHP files to avoid unauthorized use.
- **Secure Directories:** Prevents access to sensitive directories (e.g. `logs`, `media`).
- **Localhost-Only Scripts:** Ensures certain scripts are accessible only from `127.0.0.1`, enabling secure execution by Cron jobs in this project's context.
- **Hide Server Details:** Removes the `X-Powered-By` header for security.
- **Enforce HTTPS:** Redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS for secure communication.
- **URL Token Validation:** Validates tokens in password recovery URLs to prevent misuse.
- **Redirect All PHP Files:** Redirects `.php` files to `index.php` unless explicitly whitelisted.
- **Remove `.php` Extensions:** Enables cleaner URLs by omitting the .php extension.
- **Cache Static Assets:** Sets long-term caching for static files (e.g., CSS, fonts) to enhance performance.

This `.htaccess` setup ensures secure, efficient, and professional deployment of the application.
